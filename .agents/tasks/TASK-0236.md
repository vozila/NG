# TASK-0236: Business profile editor UI

Status: TODO  
Assigned: Agent UI-C (Bundle B002)  
Date: 2026-02-20 (America/New_York)

## Objective
Build a portal UI for owner-managed business profile fields used by customer-mode grounding.

## Execution repo
- Default portal repo path: `../vozlia-admin`
- This task is front-end only (no NG backend file edits).

## Required UI capabilities
- Edit and save:
  - business name
  - hours
  - services
  - pricing
  - policy notes
- Show loading/success/error states and last saved value.
- Validate obvious client constraints (required fields, max lengths) before submit.

## API contract expectations
- Use server-side proxy route pattern from portal app.
- Consume owner-scoped backend endpoints for business profile CRUD.

## Acceptance
- Owner can load existing profile, update fields, and persist changes.
- UI prevents empty/invalid submit and shows deterministic errors.
- No backend credential leakage in browser code.

## Proof
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- Screenshot or short capture of load -> edit -> save success.
- If agent cannot run end-to-end, provide exact operator commands and expected outcomes.
