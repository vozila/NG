# TASK-0212: Owner events API + memory spine sync

Status: DONE  
Completed: 2026-02-19 (America/New_York)  
Owner: Codex Agent B  
Feature gate: `VOZ_FEATURE_OWNER_EVENTS_API=1`  
Rollback: set `VOZ_FEATURE_OWNER_EVENTS_API=0`

## Goal
Expose a read-only owner API surface backed by durable DB facts so owner-mode behavior/analytics are grounded in event history.

## What shipped
1. Added new feature module `features/owner_events_api.py`.
2. Added auth-guarded endpoints:
   - `GET /owner/events`
   - `GET /owner/events/latest`
3. Added bearer auth requirement:
   - `VOZ_OWNER_API_KEY` env is required.
   - Header must be `Authorization: Bearer <VOZ_OWNER_API_KEY>`.
   - Missing/invalid token returns `401`.
4. Endpoint data source is `core.db.query_events(...)` (read-only).
5. Synced planning/continuity docs:
   - TASK-0203 and TASK-0204 marked as settled completed state.
   - access code deterministically selects `ai_mode`.
   - Flow A audible known-good signatures documented as continuity anchors.

## Acceptance tests
- Missing/invalid bearer returns 401.
- Valid bearer with seeded events returns 200 with expected event shape.

## Invariants
- No Flow A WS hot-path changes.
- Feature defaults OFF unless explicitly enabled.
