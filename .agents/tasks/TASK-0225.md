# TASK-0225: Owner Inbox API (leads + appointment requests)

Status: DONE  
Assigned: Codex Agent (Backend / Owner Surface)  
Date: 2026-02-19 (America/New_York)

## Objective
Expose owner-ready normalized inbox endpoints so the portal can consume structured lead/appt items instead of raw events.

## Endpoints
- `GET /owner/inbox/leads`
- `GET /owner/inbox/appt_requests`

Auth / gates:
- bearer: `VOZ_OWNER_API_KEY`
- `VOZ_FEATURE_OWNER_INBOX`
- `VOZ_OWNER_INBOX_ENABLED`

## Behavior
- Deterministic select-only logic.
- Tenant isolation.
- Window bounded to max 7 days.
- `limit <= 200`.
- Best-effort joins by `rid`:
  - summary headline from `postcall.summary`
  - caller metadata from `flow_a.call_started` (`from_number`, `to_number`)
- Missing join fields returned as `null`.

## Acceptance coverage
- 401 on missing/invalid auth
- tenant isolation
- limit/window validation
- normalization fields present
- best-effort caller metadata behavior validated
