# TASK-0403: 3-agent bundle orchestration (ops memory spine sync)

Status: ACTIVE  
Assigned: Agent C (Ops Scribe / Orchestration)  
Date: 2026-02-20 (America/New_York)

## Objective
Establish an always-on 3-agent bundle model with explicit file ownership, check requirements, and log-review protocol.

## Scope (exclusive)
- `AGENTS.md`
- `ops/TASKBOARD.md`
- `ops/CHECKPOINT.md`
- `ops/JOURNAL.md`
- `ops/DECISIONS.md`
- `ops/AGENT_BUNDLES.md`

## Required behavior
- Define non-overlapping ownership per active bundle.
- Require each agent to:
  - update its task file in `.agents/tasks/`
  - update relevant `ops/*` records
  - review `ops/logs/` when event signatures are expected.
- Document required lint/check commands per agent type.

## Logging evidence required
- Journal entry with:
  - active bundle ID
  - assigned tasks
  - where logs were reviewed (`ops/logs/...`)

## Checks
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/analyze_bargein_latency.py scripts/extract_call_window.py` (if referenced)
- `ruff check AGENTS.md ops/*.md` (or markdown linter if configured)
