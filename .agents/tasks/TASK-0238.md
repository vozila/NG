# TASK-0238: OCR upload + review UI

Status: TODO  
Assigned: Agent UI-C (Bundle B002)  
Date: 2026-02-20 (America/New_York)

## Objective
Create owner UI flow to upload OCR source material, review extracted structured fields, edit, and approve.

## Execution repo
- Default portal repo path: `../vozlia-admin`
- This task is front-end only (no NG backend file edits).

## Required UI capabilities
- Upload image/file for OCR ingest.
- Show extraction result payload with confidence indicators.
- Allow owner edits before approval.
- Approve action persists reviewed output.

## API contract expectations
- Use server-side proxy route pattern.
- Consume OCR ingest + review/approve endpoints.
- Fail closed on schema or validation errors; render backend detail safely.

## Acceptance
- Upload -> extracted result visible.
- Owner can edit extracted fields and approve.
- UI communicates pending/reviewed states deterministically.

## Proof
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- Screenshot/capture of upload -> review -> approve flow.
- If agent cannot run end-to-end, provide exact operator commands and expected outcomes.
