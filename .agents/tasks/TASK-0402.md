# TASK-0402: Render log tooling hardening + operator workflow docs

Status: ACTIVE  
Assigned: Agent B (Ops Tooling)  
Date: 2026-02-20 (America/New_York)

## Objective
Harden local Render log capture/analyzer workflow so troubleshooting is deterministic and repeatable.

## Scope (exclusive)
- `scripts/capture_render_logs.sh`
- `scripts/analyze_bargein_latency.py`
- `scripts/extract_call_window.py`
- `ops/REFERENCE_PACKS/voice_flow_a.md`

## Required behavior
- Keep automatic capture, rotation, and retry behavior.
- Ensure analysis scripts produce stable output for:
  - accepted barge-ins
  - ignored-early barge-ins
  - per-call extraction.
- Keep credentials out of logs by process discipline (`umask`, no env dump).

## Logging evidence required
- Validate on real files in `ops/logs/`.
- Include one sample command output in `ops/JOURNAL.md` (no secrets).

## Checks
- `bash -n scripts/capture_render_logs.sh`
- `python3 -m py_compile scripts/analyze_bargein_latency.py scripts/extract_call_window.py`
- `ruff check scripts/analyze_bargein_latency.py scripts/extract_call_window.py`
