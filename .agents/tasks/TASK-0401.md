# TASK-0401: Flow A chunk-mode pacing parity (hot path safety)

Status: ACTIVE  
Assigned: Agent A (Voice Runtime)  
Date: 2026-02-20 (America/New_York)

## Objective
Ensure `VOICE_TWILIO_CHUNK_MODE` can remain default ON without regressing startup clarity or pacing stability.

## Scope (exclusive)
- `features/voice_flow_a.py`
- `tests/test_voice_flow_a.py`

## Required behavior
- Chunk mode must honor startup prebuffer/start-buffer and refill-hysteresis guards.
- Chunk mode must maintain stable playout pacing equivalent to 20ms/frame cadence.
- Existing barge-in semantics must remain intact.

## Logging evidence required
- Review latest `ops/logs/vozlia-ng-*.log` after deployment.
- Confirm expected signatures during a test call:
  - `OPENAI_AUDIO_DELTA_FIRST`
  - `TWILIO_MAIN_FRAME_SENT first=1`
  - `twilio_send stats`
  - `BARGE-IN` / `BARGE-IN_IGNORED_EARLY` behavior unchanged except expected tuning.

## Checks
- `ruff check features/voice_flow_a.py tests/test_voice_flow_a.py`
- `python3 -m py_compile features/voice_flow_a.py tests/test_voice_flow_a.py`
