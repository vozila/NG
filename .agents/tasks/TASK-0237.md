# TASK-0237: Template selection UI + preview

Status: TODO  
Assigned: Agent UI-C (Bundle B002)  
Date: 2026-02-20 (America/New_York)

## Objective
Provide owner UI to select an active business template and preview assistant behavior.

## Execution repo
- Default portal repo path: `apps/vozlia-admin`
- This task is front-end only (no NG backend file edits).

## Required UI capabilities
- List available templates (v1 set).
- Select active template for tenant.
- Preview panel includes:
  - greeting style
  - safe-language rules (no guarantees, escalation wording)
  - key intake fields for that template

## API contract expectations
- Use server-side proxy route pattern.
- Read/update template assignment through backend owner endpoints.

## Acceptance
- Owner can switch template and see confirmation.
- Preview updates immediately for selected template.
- Error and empty states are explicit and user-readable.

## Proof
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run build`
- Screenshot of template switch + preview update.
- If agent cannot run end-to-end, provide exact operator commands and expected outcomes.
