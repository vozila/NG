# TASK-0224: Flow A event contract — persist caller metadata (from/to)

Status: DONE  
Assigned: Codex Agent (Voice / Hot Path)  
Date: 2026-02-19 (America/New_York)

## Objective
Persist caller metadata in Flow A lifecycle events so downstream owner workflows are actionable.

## Changes
- `flow_a.call_started.payload` now includes:
  - `from_number`
  - `to_number`
- `flow_a.call_stopped.payload` now includes:
  - `from_number`
  - `to_number`

Implementation notes:
- Additive payload-only change (backward compatible).
- No DB schema changes.
- Hot-path discipline preserved (lifecycle emit points only).

## Acceptance coverage
- Deterministic helper test verifies lifecycle payload includes `from_number` and `to_number`.
- Helper test verifies missing/empty values are normalized to `None`.
